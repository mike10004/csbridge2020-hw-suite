# csbridge2020-hw-suite

Suite of programs and scripts that help complete my C++ homework assignments.

A config file named `config.json` in the `tests` module directory is parsed, and you can use it to set a log level for unit tests.

## Run unit tests from command line

    $ python3 -m unittest discover --start hwsuite
